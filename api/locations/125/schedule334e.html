          Tight muscles limit our range of motion and often set our body up for impending injury. Utilizing the same style barre as seen in dance studios, the barre is used as a prop to balance while performing exercises that focus on control and increasing flexibility to improve overall strength. You will also lift and lengthen while toning and actively stretching.
 This class is perfect for anyone who wants to tone while working on their flexibility.
