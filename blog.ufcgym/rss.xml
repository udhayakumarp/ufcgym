      <title>Benefits of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com/functional-fitness"&gt;HIIT classes&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for High Intensity Interval Training, have become one of the most popular methods of training in recent years. It focuses on pushing participants to their maximum effort level for short periods of time followed by recovery…then repeat, repeat, repeat. Despite its meteoric rise in popularity with millennials and young Gen-X’ers, it can still resonate as an intimidating workout with those who are just getting started in a fitness routine or have never trained at such a high intensity. The good news is, you don’t have to already come prepared with a chiseled hard body or years of exercise experience to get the most out of HIIT classes. HIIT is about pushing people &lt;u&gt;safely&lt;/u&gt; towards their physical limits which vary from person to person. Here are some great reasons you should try a HIIT class:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Chose UFC GYM</title>
      <link>http://blog.ufcgym.com/why-i-chose-ufc-gym</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="http://blog.ufcgym.com/why-i-chose-ufc-gym" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.ufcgym.com/hubfs/Family%20DUT%20image-Blog%20Image.jpg?t=1519328488145" alt="Family DUT image-Blog Image.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Hey there! My name’s Candice Becker, 30 year old mom of two (Jackson and Camdyn) and wife to Brett. I’ve been involved in the fitness industry either for work or by passion for the past 12 years. I’ve seen and tried it all. After moving back to Orange County from Atlanta, and ready to pop with Camdyn, I found myself struggling with which gym to join after moving back. I knew we needed a kids club, but wasn’t crazy about the large gym chains near us...the memberships were pricey once we factored in the kids’ memberships on top of ours and the classes were never&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;challenging. I loved the idea of joining a boutique gym, but the prices were high, they didn’t offer kids club and the class selections were so small... I was stuck. It wasn’t until my husband asked for a UFC GYM membership for Christmas that I’d even considered walking into one of their gyms. After seeing the presentation in the pre-sale office, I knew this option would work for my entire family! They had so many class options, kids were included, and the price was right!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After joining, I had been itching so bad to get Camdyn (Cammie) into a gym so I could workout, I literally took her in the day she turned 6 months old. Within a few gym visits, I had met all the staff, and each time I came to pick up the kids, the staff filled me in on their activities that day. There is a tremendous amount of value I’ve felt from the beginning at UFC GYM in having great staff and a fun area for my kids to play for FREE with my membership!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most of my time spent in the gym is spent taking classes. I’ve tried many, but my favorites still seem to be D.U.T, Boxing and Kickboxing Conditioning, and MATRX. The best part of the classes is that they’re never the same workout. Every time I go it’s something new, a different circuit, different combo... it keeps things exciting, and I’m never left wanting more. I work out often, and these classes kick my butt... every time! They are run by “coaches” not trainers, and they do exactly that, they coach and motivate everyone, and get the members to do the same. Everyone in the class becomes your teammate. It’s so much fun to have people you recognize coming to get their butt kicked with you over and over again! I love that each coach has their own unique background and skill set. The company has really done a great job finding great talent and encouraging them to bring in their own referrals to keep the team growing. UFC GYM brings in the best of the best!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I took away from our time living in Atlanta was the word “community” and what it meant to incorporate that into our lives. I’d never really had that in a neighborhood, or gym for that matter... Now, every time I walk into our UFC GYM I have a smile on my face. I know I’ll run into people I know, catch up with new friends, get a hello and good bye from the front desk staff, and be cheered on by my teammates. If I miss days at the gym, people take time to check up on me, and I do the same for others. A big part of that sense of community starts the minute you join the gym. Most of the locations also have a Facebook page. It’s a great way to introduce yourself to the group, and find others you have common interests with. People post questions, post transformations, etc. It’s really motivating to be put in a group of so many with same interests and goals, working together. I’ve never had that feeling or involvement from any of the other gyms or boutique places I’ve worked out at before.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For me to be consistent at a gym or studio and &amp;nbsp;not get bored after a few months, there have to be “it” factors, and UFC GYM’s, and the people in them are what keep me going. I may try new concepts here and there, but I’m glad that I have this as my home base, and second family for my family and I.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Sweat is dripping, your heart is pounding, and your legs are shaking. You hear the Coach yell, “One more minute”. That’s one more minute for you to burn those calories, melt away the fat, and leave feeling satisfied. Your teammate next to you gives you a pat on the back and says, “let’s do this”. You grab your kettlebell and go to work. This is &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com"&gt;UFC GYM’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t"&gt;Daily Ultimate Training (D.U.T)&lt;/a&gt;, a functional workout targeting your entire body, and sure to deliver results.

      <title>Boxing For Women</title>
      <link>http://blog.ufcgym.com/boxing-for-women-0</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="hs-featured-image-wrapper"&gt; 
 &lt;a href="http://blog.ufcgym.com/boxing-for-women-0" title="" class="hs-featured-image-link"&gt; &lt;img src="https://blog.ufcgym.com/hubfs/Women%20Boxing.jpg?t=1519328488145" alt="Women Boxing.jpg" class="hs-featured-image" style="width:auto !important; max-width:50%; float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: 400;"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I’m former professional mixed martial artist in the flyweight division with a 2-0 record, Franchise Development Associate for &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com"&gt;UFC GYM&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly a mother of two amazing kids. After the back to back pregnancies of my son and daughter, I weighed only 112 pounds at 5’9” and was completely frail, depleted, and exhausted. I was bored in a traditional gym setting, so I explored my options and found a local martial arts gym that offered strength and conditioning classes (similar to UFC GYM’s &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t"&gt;Daily Ultimate Training&lt;/a&gt;). I tried a class and immediately signed up for a membership. I loved the diversity and challenge of training with different training apparatus like kettlebells, sledgehammers, and battle ropes. While participating in strength and conditioning classes, I always observed the different martial arts classes that were happening simultaneously on the mats on the other side of the gym and decided one day to hop into that class instead. It was boxing, and I was HOOKED! My venture as a woman in the world of mixed martial arts was born. While the reasons why I think boxing is the best workout for women are endless, here are my top three:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m former professional mixed martial artist in the flyweight division with a 2-0 record, Franchise Development Associate for &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com"&gt;UFC GYM&lt;/a&gt;, and most importantly a mother of two amazing kids. After the back to back pregnancies of my son and daughter, I weighed only 112 pounds at 5’9” and was completely frail, depleted, and exhausted. I was bored in a traditional gym setting, so I explored my options and found a local martial arts gym that offered strength and conditioning classes (similar to UFC GYM’s &lt;a href="https://ufcgym.com/classes/daily-ultimate-training-d-u-t"&gt;Daily Ultimate Training&lt;/a&gt;). I tried a class and immediately signed up for a membership. I loved the diversity and challenge of training with different training apparatus like kettlebells, sledgehammers, and battle ropes.
